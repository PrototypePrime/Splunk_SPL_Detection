## 📋 Overview

This repository provides **production-ready detection rules** and **detection engineering methodology**:

1.  **📚 Production Detection Library**: 50+ battle-tested SPL correlation searches ready for immediate deployment in your Splunk environment.
2.  **🛠️ Detection Engineering Reference**: A comprehensive [Framework Guide](docs/FRAMEWORK.md) defining our naming conventions, severity levels, and search best practices.

**Repository Value:** *Deploy our detection logic as-is, adapt it to your environment, or use our proven patterns as references when building your own custom detections.*

### Key Features
✅ **Battle-tested** - Validated across enterprise environments  
✅ **Low noise** - Tuned for <5% false positive rate  
✅ **MITRE-mapped** - Aligned to ATT&CK framework  
✅ **Response-ready** - Includes investigation playbooks  
✅ **CIM-Compatible** - Aligned with Common Information Model (Best Practice)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Splunk Enterprise Security 7.0+
- Required Technical Add-ons (TAs) for your data sources
- Accelerated CIM data models (Authentication, Endpoint, Network Traffic) **(Optional)**

### How to Use This Library

#### Option A: Deploy Production Rules (Recommended) ⚡
1.  **Browse** the detection categories above (e.g., `Authentication/T1110_Brute_Force.spl`).
2.  **Copy** the production-ready SPL query.
3.  **Test** in your Splunk environment to validate data visibility.
4.  **Deploy** as a Correlation Search in Enterprise Security.

#### Option B: Adapt for Your Environment (Flexible) 🛠️
1.  **Start** with a production rule from the library.
2.  **Customize** for your environment:
    *   Adjust thresholds based on your baseline
    *   Add environment-specific exclusions
    *   Modify field names to match your data model
3.  **Reference** the `templates/` directory for detection pattern examples.

#### Option C: Contribute Back (Community) 🤝
1.  **Fork** this repository.
2.  **Improve** existing rules or add new detection logic.
3.  **Submit** a Pull Request to share your work with the community.

## 📖 Detection Engineering Workflow

Whether you are using our rules or building your own, we recommend this standard workflow:

    B -->|Our Library| C[3. Test with Data]
    B -->|Custom Template| D[2. Write SPL Query]
    D --> C
    C --> E{FP Rate?}
    E -->|>5%| F[4. Tune Filters]
    F --> C
    E -->|<5%| G[5. Document FPs]
    G --> H[6. Peer Review]
    H --> I[7. Deploy to Production]
    I --> J[8. Monitor 48hrs]

    style E fill:#ea580c,color:#fff,stroke:#c2410c,stroke-width:3px
```

### 1. The Logic Core (SPL)
Our rules are built for **Search Efficiency**. We prioritize filtering by `index` and `sourcetype` early in the pipeline to ensure speed without relying on accelerated data models.

**Example Logic:**
```spl
index=security sourcetype=WinEventLog:Security EventCode IN (4625, 4624)
| eval action=case(
    EventCode=4625, "failure",
    EventCode=4624, "success",
    1=1, "unknown"
)
| stats 
    count(eval(action="failure")) as failed_attempts,
    count(eval(action="success")) as successful_attempts
    by user, dest
| where failed_attempts >= 5 AND successful_attempts >= 1
```

### 2. Testing & Validation
Before deploying, validate the logic using **Event-Horizon**.

**Recommended Tool:** [Event-Horizon](https://github.com/PrototypePrime/Event_Horizon)

Use **Event-Horizon** to generate production-quality security logs for validation:
- **Realistic Data:** Generate logs for 80+ technologies (Palo Alto, Windows, AWS, etc.).
- **Golden Master Templates:** Ensure 100% format accuracy for testing field extractions.
- **AI Attack Simulation:** Orchestrate coordinated kill chains to validate correlation rules.

```bash
# Example: Generate 100 Windows Security Logs to test your new rule
python main.py --sourcetype WinEventLog:Security --count 100
```
